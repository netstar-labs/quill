# Stage 2 audit: decisions held for the owner

Date 2026-10-29, against HEAD 1da37fc. The stage 2 audit (pass A1, round 2: adversarial audit in four
dimensions) applied every finding that is behaviour-preserving, or that fixes a clear defect with a regression
test, and held back every finding whose fix changes observable behaviour, an exported error class, an exit code,
a CLI grammar, an on-disk or output shape, or the wording of a guarantee. This file lists those held items, one
section each, with the claim, why it was held (what the fix would change), a recommended answer and whatever fix
is already written. The full items (grounds, warrant, backing, rebuttal, skeptic votes and reproductions) are in
the per-dimension reports: [correctness](a1-round2-correctness.md), [docs](a1-round2-docs.md) and
[dedup](a1-round2-dedup.md); the counts are in [a1-round2-findings.md](a1-round2-findings.md).

The recommended answers are the recorder's reading of the auditor's proposed fix and the skeptics' notes; they are
recommendations, not decisions. No held item has a fix committed. Where a fix is written out below it is the
proposed fix, or a prototype in the session's scratch area that passed the suite and was not committed. Ranked by
severity, then reach.

## A1-67: the documented rewind of an ahead consumer, `quill commit`, cannot work (high)

**Claim.** A consumer whose offset is above Head+1 (after a restore that rolled the log back) fails to open with
ErrAhead, and `quill commit` opens the consumer before committing, so the remedy named in docs/userguide.md:98 and
:222-223, scope.md:325 and decision 53 fails with the same error. `quill check` prints HEALTHY and `quill consumers`
shows the consumer with lag 0 and no note.

**Why held.** The only fix that makes the documented remedy true changes behaviour: `commit` (and the library path it
uses) would have to open an ahead consumer, which decisions 36 and 53 currently refuse at open. The doc-only fix is not
held in principle, but it names a sequence (unregister, register, commit) that the owner should agree is the supported
one, because `unregister` drops the protect flag.

**Recommended answer.** Both. Now: correct the user guide to name the working sequence (`quill unregister`, `quill
register [-protect]`, `quill commit -offset N`) and say that unregister drops the protect flag. Approve: let `quill
commit` (an option or an internal open path used only by commit) open an ahead consumer and accept a rewind to any
offset in [first, Head+1]; and have `quill check` or `quill consumers` flag a consumer ahead of the head.

**Fix written.** None. The proposed fix is the one above; the reproduction (a 5-record log, a consumer committed at 8,
the log restored to head 5, `commit -offset 2` failing) is in the docs report.

## A1-80: a live protected consumer stops the writer from restarting (high)

**Claim.** `Config.ProtectedConsumers` makes Open, and `quill prune` (which feeds the policy back in), fail with
ErrLocked whenever a live consumer process holds that consumer's lock; the writer cannot be redeployed while its
protected consumer runs. `quill prune` also prints "a writer holds the log", naming the wrong lock. Reproduced on macOS
and, by the auditor, Linux ext4: a reopen takes 202 to 233 ms and fails.

**Why held.** The fix changes what Open does with `ProtectedConsumers` (decision 67: protect a lazy consumer before its
process starts) and how it interacts with the per-consumer lock (guarantee 5): Open would stop needing exclusive
ownership of an existing consumer file. It also changes the `prune` verb's Config.

**Recommended answer.** Approve. In Open, create the consumer file when missing without taking exclusive ownership of
an existing one; where the file exists and is parseable, accept it and set the protect flag only when it is absent or
off (under a short retry if the lock is held); make `quill prune` drop ProtectedConsumers from the policy-derived Config
(decision 99 already says offline verbs open without protected consumers); report ErrLocked with the right lock name.
The workaround today is to drop ProtectedConsumers from the Config after the first run.

**Fix written.** None. A regression test is proposed: reopen with a held consumer lock.

## A1-25: after a failed rotation the active segment can outgrow the 1.5 GiB limit (medium)

**Claim.** While rotation keeps failing (decision 60(d) keeps appending), nothing bounds the active segment, so it can
pass the 1.5 GiB limit that Open and readers enforce; the log then cannot be opened although every record was
acknowledged durable. Reproduced on macOS: a read-only log directory, 400 appends of 4 MiB, a 1,677,729,073-byte segment,
and Open then refuses it. The same overshoot is reachable with no fault when SegmentBytes is 1 GiB and FlushBytes or
MaxBufferBytes exceed 512 MiB (read, not run).

**Why held.** The fix refuses appends in a state decision 60(d) deliberately keeps accepting them, so it changes the
contract of Append and amends the decision. It also adds a Config validation.

**Recommended answer.** Approve a ceiling. Once a pending rotation error exists, refuse new records with that error when
the active segment plus buffer would exceed SegmentBytes + MaxBufferBytes + max(MaxBatchBytes, MaxPayloadBytes+34), and
always stay below `maxSegmentBytes`; validate that SegmentBytes plus the largest single-flush overshoot is under
`maxSegmentBytes`; make the SegmentError for an oversize but intact file say so instead of "damaged at byte 0 (intact to
byte 0)"; amend decision 60(d) and the user guide. Alternative: keep the behaviour and document that a supervisor must
watch `Err()`.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-32: the reserved `_archive` consumer cannot be removed or rewound (medium)

**Claim.** The consumer `quill archive` creates is protected, and `register`, `unregister`, `commit` and the library's
`DeleteConsumer` all refuse its name ("a leading underscore is reserved"). It pins segments at or above its offset until the
next archive; after a restore that leaves it ahead of the head, `quill archive` fails with ErrAhead and the userguide's
remedy (`quill commit`) is refused for exactly this consumer. Deleting `consumers/_archive` by hand, or setting ConsumerTTL,
clears it; neither is documented for it.

**Why held.** It changes an exported function's behaviour and the CLI's accepted names, and decision 41 reserves the prefix
on purpose.

**Recommended answer.** Approve: let `DeleteConsumer`, `unregister`, `commit` and `register` accept exactly the reserved
archiver name (a second validator), or give `quill archive` a `-reset` option; document the remedy in the user guide.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-47: extra positional arguments are silently ignored (medium)

**Claim.** Every verb except `append` ignores positional arguments, and Go's flag parsing stops at the first one, so
`quill -dir L read 100` prints from the first retained record and `quill -dir L tail 5 -json` prints text, both exit 0.

**Why held.** It turns previously successful (if misdirected) invocations into exit 2.

**Recommended answer.** Approve. After `fs.Parse`, if the verb does not take arguments and `len(fs.Args()) > 0`, return a
usage error ("unexpected argument ...; flags go before arguments"). `append` and `help` (which takes a verb name) are
exempt.

**Fix written.** None; the proposed change is one check in cmd/quill/verbs.go.

## A1-48: `-from`, `-limit` and `-n` parse numbers in base 0 (medium)

**Claim.** `-n 010` is 8 records, `-from 0x10` is 16 and `-limit 1_0` is 10, while `-offset`, `-max-bytes`,
`-min-free-bytes`, `-max-records` and `@unix` times are plain decimal (`010` is 10; `0x10` is refused).

**Why held.** A previously accepted spelling (hex, underscores, octal) changes meaning or is refused.

**Recommended answer.** Approve: register the three flags through a small `flag.Value` that calls `parseDecimal`, as the others
do. The silent octal reading of a zero-padded number is the dangerous part; hex is arguably a feature, but one rule across the
CLI is simpler to document.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-82: a read I/O error is reported as ErrCorrupt or a skippable gap (medium)

**Claim.** In `scanSource`, any error from `walk`, frame errors and I/O errors alike, becomes ErrCorrupt (active segment, with
the cause flattened) or a `*GapError` over the whole segment (sealed). Decision 79 says an I/O error is returned as that error,
never as ErrCorrupt, and scope.md's resume idiom ("iterate again from To + 1") makes a consumer skip a whole segment after one
transient EIO.

**Why held.** It changes which error class the read paths return (ErrCorrupt and `*GapError` become the underlying I/O error),
which callers may match on.

**Recommended answer.** Approve: return non-frame errors unwrapped (wrapped with `%w` so `errors.Is(EIO)` works) for both
segment kinds; keep `*GapError` for real frame damage; add a Sim EIO-on-read test. The sealed-segment half is arguable under
decision 38, but the active-segment half contradicts decision 79 outright.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-85: Reader-created consumer files ignore the log's Perm (medium)

**Claim.** `Reader.consumerStore` hard-codes 0o600 and `Archive` hard-codes 0o600; `ReaderOptions` has no Perm. In the group
arrangement scope.md describes, a consumer process in another account creates a file the writer cannot read, and retention
then treats the consumer as broken (every segment protected, `check` UNHEALTHY). A skeptic ran the cross-user case on the Linux
box with `Config{Perm: 0660}` and confirmed it.

**Why held.** It changes the modes of files created through a Reader and the CLI, and may add a `ReaderOptions` field and a
flag.

**Recommended answer.** Approve: derive the mode of Reader-created files from the log (the permission bits of its existing
files, inferred as the least-surprise source), or add `ReaderOptions.Perm` and a CLI flag; use the same for Archive; document it.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-13: Archive returns ErrCorrupt, not ErrFutureVersion, for a newer destination format (medium)

**Claim.** The state-file load sequence is written six times (three for quill.format, three for quill.tail); Archive's copy wraps
every `decodeFormat` error as ErrCorrupt, so a destination whose quill.format is `quill/2` gives ErrCorrupt where Open and
OpenReader give ErrFutureVersion (decision 6, errors.go:16-17, format.md:137).

**Why held.** The fix changes the error class an exported function returns; the dedup into `loadFormat` and `loadTail` is net
zero lines.

**Recommended answer.** Approve; decision 6 already says ErrFutureVersion. If the owner prefers "any unusable destination
marker is ErrCorrupt" for Archive, keep archive.go's wrapping and merge only the load.go and reader.go pair.

**Fix written.** A prototype (the two helpers in state.go, six sites switched, +42/-42 lines) passed the full suite in a scratch
copy; it was not committed. A test that Archive into a `quill/2` destination matches ErrFutureVersion is proposed.

## A1-69: MaxBatchBytes is checked against a 34-byte-per-record estimate (medium)

**Claim.** The docs call MaxBatchBytes the largest encoded batch, but append.go:30 checks `34 + len(payload)` per record, so 500,000
one-byte records (about 7.5 MB encoded, under half of 16 MiB) are refused, and `quill append` from stdin (one batch) refuses
everything. Reproduced on macOS and Linux.

**Why held.** Making the check exact, or chunking stdin, changes behaviour and (for stdin) the all-or-nothing property of one
batch.

**Recommended answer.** Document it now: say the limit is checked against `len(payload)+34` per record (an upper bound on the
encoded size) and that `quill append` from stdin is subject to it (about 480,000 one-byte lines per call at the default). Leave
the check conservative; the disk-bound formula depends on the over-count. Chunking stdin is optional and gives up atomicity.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-2: a case-variant duplicate key in quill.tail wins silently (low)

**Claim.** The slow path accepts a key such as `SEQ`, and `{"seq":1,"SEQ":2,...}` resolves to Seq 2 with no error, because
`checkDuplicateKeys` compares exact strings while `encoding/json` matches field names case-insensitively; it also accepts trailing
whitespace, reordered keys and a missing newline. format.md:103-105 says a duplicate key is refused.

**Why held.** The strictness of a state file is a guarantee-9 question, and decision 105 deliberately preserved the slow path's
verdicts; A1-1 (round-1-decided) would instead make the marker canonical-only.

**Recommended answer.** Make the duplicate check case-insensitive (the only part that contradicts "a duplicate key is refused") and
document in format.md which non-canonical shapes are tolerated (whitespace, order, a missing newline). Do not reopen decision 105's
canonical-only question unless taking A1-1.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-29: Open refuses a symlinked Dir that OpenReader accepts (low)

**Claim.** `mkdirAll` uses Lstat, so `Open(Config{Dir: link})` returns ErrNoLog "is not a directory" for a symlink to a directory, while
`OpenReader(link)` and a symlinked parent both work. Nothing documents the writer-side restriction.

**Why held.** Either choice changes behaviour (follow the link, or keep refusing with a different error), and the refusal may be
deliberate hardening.

**Recommended answer.** Follow a symlinked final component of `Dir` (`os.Stat`), keeping O_NOFOLLOW for everything inside the log
directory, and make OpenReader and the CLI agree (a deployment that symlinks its data directory is common; the planted-link threat
needs write access to the parent, which SECURITY.md excludes, inferred). Otherwise keep the refusal, document it and say "Dir is a
symbolic link" in the error.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-35: one future-stamped segment pins age expiry of every newer one (low)

**Claim.** The age sweep is a strict prefix rule (`if s.lastAt > cutoff { break }`), so a segment whose last record is stamped in the
future blocks age expiry of everything after it until the clock catches up; decision 44's guard covers only a clock that moves
forward. Nothing is logged. The caps still bound disk and `quill check` flags the record.

**Why held.** A fixed policy (judge such a segment by its seal time, or skip it) is a design choice; prefix deletion is deliberate.

**Recommended answer.** Minimum: log a warning when the sweep stops at a segment whose last stamp is more than a day in the future,
and document the hazard beside decision 44. Do not change the prefix rule.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-50: `-json` passes C1 control characters raw (low)

**Claim.** `appendJSONString` copies valid UTF-8 above 0x7f except U+2028 and U+2029, so U+0080 to U+009F (for example the CSI
introducer U+009B) reach the terminal raw in `-json`, contradicting userguide.md:198-199 and scope.md:188; the text form escapes them. DEL
(0x7f) also passes raw.

**Why held.** It changes the bytes `-json` emits (decision 35 pins them).

**Recommended answer.** Approve: escape U+0080 to U+009F (and 0x7f) as `\u00XX`; the JSON stays valid and lossless; update the test that
compares with `encoding/json`. Whether a given terminal honours 8-bit C1 in UTF-8 mode was not tested; the documentation promise is broken
either way.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-52: Read can exceed MaxReadBytes by one record (low)

**Claim.** The cap is checked after each record, so a read returns up to cap plus one record (at defaults about 16 MiB plus up to 64 MiB - 32),
contradicting "at most `limit` records and `MaxReadBytes` of payload, but always at least one" (read.go:12-14, scope.md). Reproduced on macOS.

**Why held.** Either stopping earlier (an observable change to batch sizes) or rewording a documented bound.

**Recommended answer.** Reword the three docs to "stops once at least MaxReadBytes have been returned"; the shorter wordings already read
that way, the overshoot is bounded by one record, and a hard cap needs the frame length before cloning. Stopping before a record that would
exceed the cap unless `count == 0` is the alternative.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-57: `stat -json` holes use capitalised keys and `null` (low)

**Claim.** `quill stat -json` serialises a hole as `{"From":..,"To":..}` and an empty list as `null`, while every other CLI JSON key is
lowercase; no document fixes the stat, check or consumers schema.

**Why held.** The first public release freezes whatever scripts parse, so the shape is a decision, and changing it is a breaking change later.

**Recommended answer.** Approve before release: emit `[{"from":..,"to":..}]`, always an array, through a local tagged struct, and document the
stat, check and consumers JSON schemas in the reference.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-87: the clock guard rounds up where the text says "at most 25%" (low)

**Claim.** `limit := (len(l.sealed) + 3) / 4` deletes the ceiling of a quarter (2 of 5, 4 of 15) where decision 44 and scope.md say "at most
25% (at least one)"; retention_test.go:266 pins the larger number.

**Why held.** Changing the code changes which segments a pass deletes and a test; changing the text amends a decision.

**Recommended answer.** Reword the text to "a quarter, rounded up, at least one" (the difference is at most three segments; the owner accepted
"25% per pass" without a rounding rule). The alternative is `max(1, n/4)` and a test change.

**Fix written.** None.

## A1-91: a quill.policy of `{}` is acted on as retention 0 (low)

**Claim.** `{}`, `null` and `{"unknown":1}` parse as a valid policy of zeros; `quill ls` shows RETENTION 0s and `quill prune` runs with the default
24 h and no caps. A version-skewed policy (a future writer renaming fields) would produce such a file, and decision 68's rationale is that offline
tools must not prune with default retention. v0.1.0 writers always write every field (an off retention is `-1ns`).

**Why held.** The tolerant parse is deliberate (decisions 29 and 48) and one skeptic voted REFUTED (code and spec agree); the fix adds a refusal.

**Recommended answer.** Approve, low priority: treat a policy with no `retention` (or no known field) as unparseable for the offline tools, and print
the retention as "unknown" in `ls`. Declining is defensible.

**Fix written.** None.

## Not held, but unresolved

**A1-62: `Config.Logger` is called with the log's mutex held.** A handler that calls back into the Log deadlocks it, and a blocked handler stalls
Append, Read, Sync and the flusher. A fix was written (commit fdcd880fe2e4, branch `stage2/A1-62`, not in this tree): records are queued under the lock
and delivered after it, on the caller's goroutine and, for the flusher's records, on a delivery goroutine that Close waits for. The fix-skeptic rejected
it: `logf` still calls the handler's `Enabled` method under `l.mu` (retention.go:294), so an `Enabled` that calls `l.Head()` deadlocks the log, and a handler
whose `Enabled` and `Handle` share a mutex stalls the flusher behind a blocked `Handle` (an Append and Sync loop did not finish in 8 s; the control finished in
0.38 s). The new documentation in Config.Logger, userguide.md:148 and scope.md promises more than the code gives. Recommended answer: finish the fix by not
calling `Enabled` under the lock (queue unconditionally and filter at delivery, or call `Enabled` in the deliverer) and add a test with a blocking `Enabled`; or
take the cheaper route and document that the handler runs under the log's lock and must neither call the Log nor block.

**A1-59: the Log's own reads return a raw ENOENT where the Reader returns a GapError.** Decided in round 1 (decision 103) and not held, but raised again
independently by two fresh auditors, with a real-concurrency reproduction (raw ENOENT in 25 of 1,601 reads on macOS and 17 of 1,483 on Linux). Recommended
answer: reopen the decision and take the one-line mapping at read.go:295, amending decision 103's sentence "a deleted one fails at its open as before", which
contradicts guarantee 14. See [a1-round2-correctness.md](a1-round2-correctness.md), item 16.
